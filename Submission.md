- (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the assignment? How would you improve this
- Regarding this, what I want to say is that finding bugs in other people's code has been very challenging and interesting so far.
- Because in previous assignments, I always assumed that the code given by the teacher was one hundred percent correct. If there were any questions, I always felt that I was the one who was wrong.
